I actively cultivate my [T-Shaped Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) to become more effective at my profession. Throughout my career, I've deliberately gained hands-on experience in:

- Back-end Design and Development
- Front-end Design and Development
- CI/CD and DevOps
- Field Delivery
- Operations and Customer Support
- Project Management
- Community Management
- Software Product Management
- IT Business Management
