### Software Engineer Focused on Mastering the Art of Software Development

Throughout my career, I have been cultivating my [T-Shaped Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) to become more effective at my profession. This involved hands-on experience in the following responsibilities:

- Back-end Design and Development
- Front-end Design and Development
- CI/CD and DevOps
- Field Delivery
- Operations and Customer Support
- Project Management
- Community Management
- Software Product Management
- IT Business Management

To ensure that I keep my focus, I always refer to the question "How can this experience make me a more effective member of a software organization?"

Iâ€™ve been having a blast learning from my deliberately varied experiences. However, my learning is far from over and I continue to look forward to every new day because if there's only one lesson I've learned, it's that there's always something new and exciting to learn everyday.
