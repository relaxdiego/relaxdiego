I love building software and I've dedicated my career to mastering as many
of the art's numerous aspects. I've done this by taking on the various
challenges that come my way, learning as much as I can and delivering as best
as I can. Taking pride in the systems that I build. To this end, I have
gained experience in:

- Entrepreneurship
- Technical Product Management
- Community Management
- Field Delivery
- DevOps
- Back-end Design and Development
- Front-end Design and Development
